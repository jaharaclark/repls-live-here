# Instructions

Create a program that:

- Calculates length of the first and last name INPUT combined
- Count only the non-blank characters.

After getting the full name, the program should output

```txt
Hello, {fullName}!
Your name is {nameLength} characters long.
```

> Replace `{fullName}` and `{nameLength}` with the program values
>
> NOTE: Whitespace, tabs, and new-lines are considered blank

## Example

```txt
What is your first name? Grace
What is your last name? Hopper
Hello, Grace Hopper!
Your name is 11 characters long.
```
